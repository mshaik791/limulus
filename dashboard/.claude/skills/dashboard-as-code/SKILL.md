# Dashboard-as-code

Generate and edit Embeddable dashboards declaratively as `*.embeddable.yml` files. On `embeddable:push`, each file becomes a new dashboard version in the workspace; publishing pins that version for live embeds, so subsequent pushes never disturb anything that's already published.

## File location

`src/embeddable.com/embeddables/<name>.embeddable.yml`. New embeddables go in this directory. The filename is cosmetic — the workspace identifier is `embeddables[].name`.

## Top-level skeleton

```yaml
embeddables:
  - name: <stable-key>          # workspace identifier — treat as immutable
    title: <human-readable>     # shown in the no-code builder
    description: <repo-only>    # documentation; not stored on the server
    variables: [...]            # reactive values shared between widgets
    datasets: [...]             # data sources used by widgets
    widgets: [...]              # main canvas (static for end users)
    customCanvas: {...}         # optional: end-user-buildable canvas
```

## Workflow when generating or editing

1. **Discover available components from both sources.** Components come from (a) `componentLibraries` declared in `embeddable.config.ts` and (b) local `*.emb.ts` files under `src/embeddable.com/components/`. Walk both:
   - **Libraries**: each entry is either a string (`<package-name>`) or `{ name, include?, exclude? }`. For each enabled library, **read `node_modules/<package-name>/dist/meta/index.json` directly — do not `ls` or `Glob` the `dist/meta/` directory first.** The index gives you `name`, `label`, `category`, and `description?` in one read; filenames alone (which is all `ls` yields) lose every disambiguation signal the library author put in the descriptions, and that's the most common cause of silent wrong component picks. Apply per-library `include`/`exclude` filters after reading. **If reading `dist/meta/index.json` fails because it does not exist, tell the user which package needs to be updated and stop — never guess at component or input names, and don't fall back to listing files.**
   - **Local**: glob `src/embeddable.com/components/**/*.emb.ts` and read each file's `meta` const for `name`, `label`, `category`. An empty `components/` directory is normal — not an error.
   - Build the union as your candidate set. If a local `meta.name` collides with a library component's `name`, surface the ambiguity to the user instead of picking one.
   - Details: [references/component-discovery.md](references/component-discovery.md).
2. **Read meta lazily.** Only for the components actually being placed: read `node_modules/<package-name>/dist/meta/<componentName>.meta.json` for library components, or read the corresponding `*.emb.ts` (focus on the `meta` const; ignore the `defineComponent` call and any sibling React files) for local components. Don't bulk-load. **Use the `Read` tool on the full meta file — do not `grep` a narrow projection of fields (e.g. just `name`/`type`/`label`). Flags like `"required": true` and `"array": true` are easy to filter out by accident, and missing them produces widgets that fail validation.**
3. **Read the data models.** Inspect relevant `src/embeddable.com/models/cubes/*.cube.yml` to confirm cube/dimension/measure names exist and are typed correctly. Only join-related cubes can be referenced together inside one widget. **Ground strictly in the existing models — never invent data.** Reference only cubes/dimensions/measures that already exist; never create or edit a `*.cube.yml` (model generation is out of scope — see the "Out of scope" section at the end of this file). If the request needs data that isn't in the current models and can't be derived from them via joins, **stop and tell the user exactly which cube/measure/dimension is missing** and ask them to add it to the data model first — do not scaffold a placeholder cube, table, or members to satisfy the request.
4. **Generate or edit the YAML** under `src/embeddable.com/embeddables/`. Use the references for any non-trivial section.
5. **Check validation feedback** if `embeddable:dev` is running — see "Dev events log" below.
6. **Always offer a visual self-check.** After you create or edit any `*.embeddable.yml`, end your turn by offering — in one line — to open it in the user's browser and see how it renders (e.g. *"Want me to open it in your browser and check how it renders?"*). Make this offer **every time you touch a dashboard**, not only when conditions look right — it's a routine closing step, not an optional extra you can silently skip. Only **after the user says yes** do you check that `embeddable:dev` is running and Playwright is set up (suggest `npm run playwright:setup` if not), then follow [references/visual-preview.md](references/visual-preview.md). Never drive the browser without an explicit yes.

## Reference index

- [references/datasets.md](references/datasets.md) — dataset shape, filter operators with type rules.
- [references/variables.md](references/variables.md) — variable types, `defaultValue` semantics, `array`, the `noFilter` rule.
- [references/widgets.md](references/widgets.md) — widget anatomy, the 12-column grid, inputs, sub-inputs, events, `SET_VARIABLE`.
- [references/custom-canvas.md](references/custom-canvas.md) — `customCanvas`, templates with `key` lifecycle, icon catalog, `starterCanvas`.
- [references/component-discovery.md](references/component-discovery.md) — enumerating `componentLibraries` and reading their meta.
- [references/visual-preview.md](references/visual-preview.md) — optional: open the generated dashboard in the user's browser via Playwright, look at it, and fix render/data errors.

## Examples

Read these on demand when scaffolding a new file:

- [examples/minimal.embeddable.yml](examples/minimal.embeddable.yml) — single chart, one dataset, no variables.
- [examples/with-date-filter.embeddable.yml](examples/with-date-filter.embeddable.yml) — date range picker → bar chart wired through one variable.
- [examples/custom-canvas-template.embeddable.yml](examples/custom-canvas-template.embeddable.yml) — main canvas + customCanvas with two templates and a starter canvas.
- [examples/drill-down.embeddable.yml](examples/drill-down.embeddable.yml) — two embeddables in one file: parent with a `DRILLDOWN` event that opens the target with overrides from both an event property and a parent variable.

## Dev events log

When the user is running `embeddable:dev`, the build can emit NDJSON events to a log file. The path is **not fixed** — read `package.json` and look at the `embeddable:dev` (or `dev`) script for the `--events-file=<path>` flag, e.g.

```json
"embeddable:dev": "embeddable dev --events-file=.embeddable-dev-logs/dev.events.ndjson"
```

If the flag is absent, the log is not configured for this project — tell the user how to enable it (add the flag) rather than guessing a path.

The format is NDJSON; each line is either a `marker` (build cycle progress) or an `issue` (validation problem). Key event names: `validate_start`, `validate_end`, `validation_error`, `change_detected`. Read the log on user request ("check for errors") or right after Claude itself edits a `*.embeddable.yml`. Surface the latest error(s); on widget overlap errors, propose new coordinates that fit the grid.

This log is the **build/validation** channel. It won't tell you whether the dashboard actually *renders* — blank widgets, failed data queries, broken layout, or console errors only show up on the page. For that (once validation is clean), see the optional visual self-check in [references/visual-preview.md](references/visual-preview.md).

## Safety rules

- **`embeddables[].name`** is the workspace identifier. Renaming or deleting it removes the dashboard from the workspace, which breaks any live embeds pointing at it. It also breaks every `DRILLDOWN` event that targets it — before renaming, grep `embeddable: <old-name>` across `src/embeddable.com/embeddables/` and update or warn. Never change or delete the name without explicit user confirmation.
- **`customCanvas.templates[].key`** is the stable identifier that end-user-created widgets and `starterCanvas.widgets[].template` bind to. Changing or removing a `key` deletes every dependent widget. Treat `key` as effectively immutable. `name` and `description` are cosmetic and safe to edit. See [references/custom-canvas.md](references/custom-canvas.md).
- **Never create or edit a `*.cube.yml` (the data model).** Dashboards may only reference cubes/dimensions/measures that already exist in `src/embeddable.com/models/cubes/`. If the data a request needs is missing, **stop and tell the user exactly what's missing and ask them to add it to the model first** — do not fabricate a cube, table, or members to satisfy the request (it produces a dashboard that fails at query time). Cube/model generation is out of scope — see the "Out of scope" section at the end of this file.
- **Don't run `embeddable:push`** automatically — that's the user's call (root `CLAUDE.md`).
- **Don't start `embeddable:dev`** automatically — the user starts it themselves (root `CLAUDE.md`).

## Out of scope

- Custom variable types — only the built-in types listed in `references/variables.md` are covered.
- Custom components → the `build-component` skill.
- Cube model generation → the `create-models` skill.
- Workspace styling and client-context presets (`*.cc.yml`) → the `theming` skill.
- Security-context presets (`*.sc.yml`) — no skill yet.
